Passionate about exact sciences, graduated in engineering, I have ventured through the fields of Civil Engineering, 
Actuarial Sciences, and finally found my calling in data analysis. 
With experience in the Health Insurance and Digital Marketing sectors, I work across the entire data pipeline, including data modeling, exploratory analysis, 
pattern identification, and creating KPIs for decision-making, going beyond superficial results and initial hypotheses.
To accomplish this, I utilize tools such as SQL, Python, Power BI, and Excel, applying concepts from mathematics, statistics, and machine learning to solve business problems
